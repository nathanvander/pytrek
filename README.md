I am intrigued by the Super Star Trek game. Just for fun, I am porting various versions to different languages.

The original code is available here: https://almy.us/sst.html

This is not the code I am using.  The Go version is based on code from 
https://github.com/EtchedPixels/FUZIX/blob/master/Applications/games/startrek.c
I couldn't get the Go code to compile unless the package is named main.

The Java (and Python) version is based on code from:
https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXgamesXsourceXinform.html ztrek.inf

All of these versions will require more testing and fixing to be usable, but they compile.
